Hello and welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm currently in my third year studying Computer Science at Carleton University, and this summer, I'll be interning as a Software Engineer at Coinbase. I'm also VP of Engineering at CU Blueprint, a student-run club that uses tech to support non-profits. Previously, I interned at Shopify as a Software Developer and worked as a Teaching Assistant and Peer Mentor at Carleton. Check out some of my projects on **[GitHub](https://github.com/zhu-tom)**, connect with me on **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zhu-tom)**, or read more about me below!
