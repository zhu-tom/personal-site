bio: Hello and welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm currently in my third year studying Computer Science at Carleton University, and this summer, I'll be interning as a Software Engineer at Databricks. I'm also VP of Engineering at CU Blueprint, a student-run club that uses tech to support non-profits. Previously, I interned at Coinbase and Shopify as a Software Engineer, and worked as a Teaching Assistant and Peer Mentor at Carleton. Read more about me below!
